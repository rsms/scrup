			<h2>Version 1.3.1</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Fixes picking up screenshots which failed on some systems with Scrup 1.3.0.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section id="version-1.3">
			<h2>Version 1.3</h2><a href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4311662638_00be0d79d3_o.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4311662638_5ff27abfde_m.jpg" width="200" height="132" alt="Scrup 1.3" align="right" /></a>
			<ul>
				<li>Interactive preprocessing interface: (pictured)
					<ul>
						<li>Simple interactive interface automatically pops up when a new screenshot is taken.</li>
						<li>Add arrows, lines and other basic graphics, all editable as separate "layers".</li>
						<li>Add text annotations using different fonts and colors.</li>
						<li>Copy, paste, obscure and duplicate parts of the image.</li>
						<li>Crop images and apply basic adjustments like hue, saturation, brightness, etc.</li>
						<li>Edit the filename (which is also sent to your <tt>recv.php</tt>. With some creative
							thinking, this can be used for a wide range of tasks)</li>
						<li>Ability to cancel certain uploads.</li>
						<li>The interactive interface can be disabled in preferences, in which case Scrup 
							will not steal your attention (just like the previousversion).
						</li>
						<li>One more thing: <em>This feature is beta quality</em> (as in "a bit shaky"). Zooming is somewhat retarded and 
							changing color of text annotations have a stochastic success rate :). Please
							report any issues you think are woth fixing. Thanks.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Much more robust pick-up — no more accidentally uploading stuff you save 
					from Safari (Scrup is now reading xattrs to confirm a file is actually a legit 
					and fresh screenshot)
				</li>
				<li>Respects <tt>defaults</tt> settings in the com.apple.screencapture domain.
					Thanks to @rduenasf and @jfro</li>

			<h2>Version 1.2</h2><a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2700/4134384795_3c432eafb5_o.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2700/4134384795_3c432eafb5_o.png" width="200" alt="Screen shot" align="right" /></a>
			<ul>
				<li>Support for international, non-english systems.</li>
				<li>Images in the menu making it easy to find previous uploads.</li>
				<li>Image processing:
					<ul>
						<li>New options for processing images (found in Preferences).</li>
						<li>Produces much smaller file sizes (by using pngcrush and normalizing 
							color space — these settings are optional but enabled by default).</li>
						<li>Ability to trash scrups after they have been uploaded (not enabled by default).</li>
						<li>Ability to run arbitrary shell command or script which can register, 
							filter and process an image before it's uploaded, or decide if it should be 
							uploaded at all.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Details:
					<ul>
						<li>Lower resource usage (using DNC instead of FSEvents).</li>
						<li>Using ASL/syslog for logging. The boolean user defaults key
							<tt>debug</tt> can be set to true to enable debug and info level 
							messages to be logged.</li>
						<li>Minor stability fixes and UI improvments.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Version 1.1</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Gracefully notify users of OS X &lt;10.6 with the fact that Scrup requires &gt;=10.6.</li>
				<li>When paused a "zzZ" icon is displayed to indicate the inactive state.</li>
				<li>I/O contention work-arounds and fixes.</li>
				<li>Better error handling, especially for network related problems 
					(no connection, I/O exhaustion, etc).</li>
				<li>Obeys <tt>com.apple.screencapture location</tt> if set (See 
					<a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20050824073301844" 
					target="_blank">this Mac OS X hints article</a> for more info.
					Thanks to <a href="http://micro.dentarg.net/">Patrik Ragnarsson</a> 
					for this).</li>
				<li>Fixed a "bug" (bad behaviour) where old screenshots would be batch-uploaded 
					upon reactivation or launch. Now only fresh screenshots are processe.
					If Scrup is paused the file will never be processed, unless modified after 
					Scrup has been activated again.</li>
			</ul>
